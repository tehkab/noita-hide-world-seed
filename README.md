# Hide World Seed

Overrides some translations to hide the world seed when the game is loaded as well as in the pause (ESC) menu.

## Limitations

This does *not* hide the world seed from other mods, from the names of saved replay GIFs, log files, etc.

It's a small impediment and wont stop a determined player from finding the seed (Just mod restart without the mod enabled!)

As this is technically an override to translations, only most builtin languages (languages in common.csv) are supported:
- en
- ru
- pt-br
- es-es
- de
- fr-fr
- it
- pl
- zh-cn
- jp
- ko

Additionally, supported non-english languages currently still show english text "\<hidden\>" instead of their translated equivalent.

If you're streaming and using OnlyWands, this wont hide your seed from viewers anyway, as they can see it on OnlyWands (for now)

## Manual installation
The mod directory needs to be named 'hide-world-seed'
